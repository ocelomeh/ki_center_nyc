#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Art of Peace is medicine for a sick world. We want to cure the
world of the sickness of violence, malcontent, and discord—this is the
Way of Harmony. There is evil and disorder in the world because people
have forgotten that all things emanate from one source. Return to that
source and leave behind all self-centered thoughts, petty desires, and
anger. Those who are possessed by nothing possess everything.
